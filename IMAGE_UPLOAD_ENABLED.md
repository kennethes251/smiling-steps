5. **Preview appears** below the field
6. **Save blog** with the uploaded image

### Profile Picture Upload:

1. **Go to profile page**
2. **Click upload button**
3. **Select image**
4. **Profile picture updates**

## Upload Endpoints:

### Blog Images:
```
POST /api/upload/blog-image
Headers: x-auth-token: <your-token>
Body: FormData with 'blogImage' file
Response: { imageUrl: "/uploads/blogs/blog-123456.jpg" }
```

```

## File Storage:

Images are stored in:

Files are served statically by Express:
```javascript

```

2. Or replace with external URL anytime
