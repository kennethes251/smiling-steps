## What You'll Get

3. Client pays outside app
4. Client clicks "I've Paid"
5. Psychologist manually verifies
6. Session confirmed
```

## Cost Comparison

## Alternative: Keep Manual + Add Automation Later

You could also:

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

### A. Implement Stripe Test Mode Now
- I'll set up the complete automated payment flow
- Free for testing
- Takes about 1 hour
- Works immediately

### B. Set Up M-Pesa Sandbox
- More complex but Kenya-specific
- Free for testing
- Takes 2-3 hours
- Need Safaricom developer account

### C. Create Hybrid System
- Keep manual M-Pesa
- Add automated card payments
- Best of both worlds
- Takes 1.5 hours

## My Recommendation

**Start with Stripe Test Mode** because:
1. Free and instant setup
2. You can test the full automated flow
3. Easy to upgrade to live mode later
4. Can add M-Pesa later if needed
5. Works for international clients too

Once you're happy with how it works, you can:
- Upgrade to Stripe live mode (paid)
- Add M-Pesa Daraja API (Kenya-specific)
- Or keep both options for clients

**Ready to implement?** Just say "yes" and I'll start setting up Stripe Test Mode for free automated payments!
