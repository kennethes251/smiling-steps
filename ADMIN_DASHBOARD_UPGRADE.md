## What This Replaces

You can now **remove the Developer Dashboard** button from your navigation because all its features are now in the main Admin Dashboard with a better UI.

### Before:
- Admin Dashboard (basic stats only)
- Developer Dashboard (full features)

### After:
- Admin Dashboard (all features in tabs)
- ✅ No need for separate developer dashboard

## How to Use

1. **Login as admin**
2. **Go to `/dashboard`** (auto-routes to admin dashboard)
3. **Click tabs** to navigate between sections
4. **Use "Add Psychologist"** button to create new psychologists
5. **View All** buttons to see complete lists

## Benefits

✅ **Unified Interface** - All admin features in one place
✅ **Better Navigation** - Tab-based interface is cleaner
✅ **Quick Actions** - Easy access to common tasks
✅ **Better UX** - Consistent design across all sections
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new tabs/features
