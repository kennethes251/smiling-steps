# Psychologist Login Issue - Resolved âœ…

## The Problem

You were trying to login as a psychologist but getting a 400 error: "Invalid email or password"

## The Cause

The psychologist account you were trying to use **doesn't exist in the database**.

## Current Psychologists in Database

I checked the database and found **2 psychologists**:

1. **nancy@gmail.com** (Not verified)
2. **leon@gmail.com** (Not verified)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Login with Existing Psychologist

Use one of the existing psychologist accounts:
- Email: `nancy@gmail.com` or `leon@gmail.com`
- Password: Whatever password was set when creating the account

### Option 2: Create New Psychologist Account

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Email: `smilingsteps@gmail.com`
   - Password: Your admin password

2. **Go to Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Click "Psychologists" tab
   - Click "Add Psychologist" button

3. **Fill Out the Form**
   - Name: Dr. Sarah Johnson (or any name)
   - Email: sarah.johnson@smilingsteps.com
   - Password: secure123 (or any password)
   - Specializations: Select from dropdown
   - Experience: e.g., "8 years"
   - Education: e.g., "PhD in Clinical Psychology"
   - Bio: Brief description

4. **Or Use "Create Sample Psychologists"**
   - This creates 3 demo psychologist accounts instantly
   - All use password: `secure123`
   - Emails:
     - sarah.johnson@smilingsteps.com
     - michael.chen@smilingsteps.com
     - emily.rodriguez@smilingsteps.com

### Option 3: Create via API (Quick Test)

Run this command to create a test psychologist:

```bash
node test-psychologist-login.js
```

Then update the email/password in the script to match what you want to test.

## Why This Happened

When you migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, the database was reset. Any psychologists that existed in MongoDB are not in the new PostgreSQL database.

You need to recreate psychologist accounts using the admin dashboard.

## How to Verify Psychologists Exist

Run this script anytime to see what psychologists are in the database:

```bash
node list-psychologists.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Login as admin** (smilingsteps@gmail.com)
2. **Go to** `/admin/create-psychologist`
3. **Create psychologist accounts** you want to test with
4. **Then login** as those psychologists

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Navigate to admin dashboard
- [ ] Click "Add Psychologist" button
- [ ] Create psychologist account
- [ ] Note the email and password
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as the psychologist
- [ ] Should see psychologist dashboard

---

**The backend is working fine - you just need to create the psychologist accounts first!** ðŸŽ‰
