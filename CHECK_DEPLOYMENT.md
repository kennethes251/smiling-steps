# Check Deployment Status

## Current Status

✅ **Backend Deployed** - Admin routes working
⏳ **Frontend Deploying** - Old code still live

## Evidence:
- Login works ✅
- API calls going to correct URL ✅
- But seeing errors from old `DeveloperDashboard.js` ❌
- Should be seeing new `AdminDashboard-new.js` ✅

## What You're Seeing:

```
DeveloperDashboard.js:166 Error fetching dashboard data
/api/admin/blogs:1 Failed to load resource: 404
/api/admin/resources:1 Failed to load resource: 404
```

This is the **OLD dashboard** trying to fetch blogs/resources (which we removed).

## What You SHOULD See:

```
AdminDashboard-new.js - Loading...
/api/admin/stats - Success
/api/admin/psychologists - Success
/api/admin/clients - Success
```

This is the **NEW dashboard** with proper endpoints.

## How to Fix:

### Step 1: Check Render Deployment
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click "smiling-steps-frontend"
3. Check deployment status:
   - **Building** = Still deploying (wait)
   - **Live** = Deployment complete (refresh page)
   - **Failed** = Check logs for errors

### Step 2: Once "Live", Clear Cache
```
Method 1: Hard Refresh
- Press: Ctrl + Shift + R

Method 2: DevTools Clear
- Press F12
- Right-click refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

Method 3: Incognito
- Open incognito/private window
- Go to site
- Should see new version
```

### Step 3: Verify New Dashboard
After clearing cache, you should see:
- ✅ Clean admin dashboard
- ✅ Statistics cards (Clients, Psychologists, Sessions)
- ✅ Psychologists table
- ✅ Clients table
- ✅ No 404 errors for blogs/resources

## Timeline:

- **Push to GitHub**: ✅ Done (5 minutes ago)
- **Backend Deploy**: ✅ Complete
- **Frontend Build**: ⏳ In Progress (~3-5 minutes)
- **Frontend Live**: ⏳ Waiting...

**Check back in 2-3 minutes!**

## If Still Seeing Old Dashboard After 10 Minutes:

1. Check Render logs for build errors
2. Verify the commit was deployed
3. Try accessing directly: `/admin/dashboard`
4. Check browser console for errors
