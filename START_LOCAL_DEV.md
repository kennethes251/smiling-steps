# Start Local Development Server

## The Issue
You're trying to access the **production site** at `smiling-steps-frontend.onrender.com`, but the code changes we made are only in your **local files**. The production site still has the old code.

## Solution: Test Locally First

### 1. Start the Local Frontend Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

This will start the React dev server at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Access the Admin Page Locally
Once the server starts, go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/create-psychologist
```

### 3. Login as Admin
- Email: `smilingsteps@gmail.com`
- Password: Your admin password

### 4. Test the Form
- You should now see the create psychologist form
- Try creating a psychologist account
- Or click "Create Sample Psychologists"

## If You Want to Deploy to Production

After testing locally and confirming it works:

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix admin create psychologist route and endpoints"

# Push to trigger Render deployment
git push
```

Render will automatically rebuild and deploy your frontend with the new changes.

## Why This Happened

The changes we made are in your local codebase:
- ✅ Updated `client/src/App.js` (local)
- ✅ Updated `client/src/components/PrivateRoute.js` (local)
- ✅ Updated `client/src/pages/AdminCreatePsychologist.js` (local)

But the production site at Render still has the old code until you deploy.

## Quick Commands

**Start local dev:**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

**Deploy to production:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix admin routes"
git push
```
