## After Deployment

Once both services show "Live" status:

   - Or clear cache in browser settings

2. **Test the Admin Page**
   - Go to: https://smiling-steps-frontend.onrender.com/admin/create-psychologist
   - Login as admin if prompted
   - You should see the create psychologist form

3. **Create a Test Psychologist**

## Troubleshooting

### If Page Still Shows "Not Found"
- Wait 2-3 more minutes for deployment to complete
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check Render dashboard for deployment status
- Look for any build errors in Render logs

### If API Errors Occur
- Check backend deployment completed successfully
- Verify backend logs in Render dashboard
