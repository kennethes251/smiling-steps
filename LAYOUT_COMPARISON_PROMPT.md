**"Hi Kiro, I need help making my Netlify site layout match my localhost exactly. Here are the specific differences I'm seeing:**

### **🌐 URLs I'm comparing:**
- **Local server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Netlify site**: https://smiling-steps.netlify.app

### **📱 Page I'm focusing on:**
- **Landing Page** (the homepage)

### **🔍 Specific layout differences I see:**

#### **Section 1: [Name the section - e.g., "Hero Section"]**
- **On localhost**: [Describe what you see - e.g., "Shows large slideshow with 6 rotating images, 'Smiling Steps' title, tagline, and two buttons"]
- **On Netlify**: [Describe what you see - e.g., "Only shows a blank space" or "Shows different content"]
- **Missing/Different**: [Be specific - e.g., "Missing the slideshow images" or "Buttons are different colors"]

#### **Section 2: [Name the section - e.g., "Therapist Profiles"]**
- **On localhost**: [Describe what you see]
- **On Netlify**: [Describe what you see]
- **Missing/Different**: [Be specific]

#### **Section 3: [Continue for each section]**
- **On localhost**: 
- **On Netlify**: 
- **Missing/Different**: 

### **🎨 Visual differences I notice:**
- **Colors**: [e.g., "Localhost has purple theme, Netlify has blue theme"]
- **Fonts**: [e.g., "Different font family"]
- **Spacing**: [e.g., "Elements are too close together"]
- **Images**: [e.g., "Profile pictures not loading"]
- **Buttons**: [e.g., "Buttons look different or missing"]

### **⚡ Functionality differences:**
- **What works on localhost**: [e.g., "All buttons click and work"]
- **What doesn't work on Netlify**: [e.g., "Get Started button doesn't work"]
- **Loading issues**: [e.g., "Page loads slowly" or "Some sections don't appear"]

### **📊 Browser console errors (if any):**
- **Open browser console (F12) on Netlify site and copy any red error messages here**
- **API Test box shows**: [e.g., "✅ API Connected" or "❌ API Error: ..."]

### **📸 Screenshots (if possible):**
- **Localhost screenshot**: [Describe or attach]
- **Netlify screenshot**: [Describe or attach]

**Please help me make the Netlify layout look exactly like the localhost layout, section by section.**"

## 🎯 **Example of a good description:**

**"The localhost shows a full landing page with:**
1. **Header** with logo and navigation
2. **Hero section** with rotating slideshow and big title
3. **Problem statement** section with text and images
4. **Benefits section** with 4 purple cards
5. **Features section** 
6. **Therapist profiles** with real photos
7. **Footer**

**But Netlify only shows:**
- The Benefits section with 4 cards
- Missing everything else
- API Test box shows "❌ API Error: Network Error"

**I want Netlify to show the complete page exactly like localhost.**"
