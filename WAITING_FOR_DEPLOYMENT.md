- ❌ Old version still cached

### What You'll See After Deployment:
- ✅ "Upload Image" button above the URL field
- ✅ File picker when you click the button
- ✅ Image preview after upload
- ✅ Progress indicator
- ✅ Option to use URL OR upload file

## Timeline

**Deployment Started**: ~5 minutes ago
**Expected Completion**: ~3-5 more minutes
**Total Time**: ~8-10 minutes from push

## What to Do

### Option 1: Wait for Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Check Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. **Look for "smiling-steps-frontend"** service
3. **Wait for status**: "Live" (not "Deploying")
4. **Then hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Option 2: Check Deployment Progress
Go to Render dashboard and look at the deployment logs to see progress.

### Option 3: Use URL for Now
While waiting, you can still use the URL field:
1. Upload image to any image hosting service (Imgur, etc.)
2. Paste URL in the "Featured Image URL" field
3. Continue creating your blog

## After Deployment Completes

### Step 1: Clear Cache
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
Or: Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached images
```

### Step 2: Refresh the Page
Go back to `/admin/blogs` and you should see:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Featured Image URL
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

```

### Step 3: Test Upload

## If Still Not Showing After 10 Minutes

## Temporary Workaround

While waiting, you can use free image hosting:

- **Cloudinary**: https://cloudinary.com/

Upload there, copy URL, paste in the URL field.

**Just wait a few more minutes for the deployment to complete!** ⏰

The upload button will appear once the new frontend code is live.
