4. **Establish the same boundaries** as in-person sessions
5. **Begin with your usual opening routine**

## 👥 Managing Client Experience

### Helping Clients with Technology

**Common Client Issues:**
1. **Can't see "Join Call" button** - Check payment status and timing
2. **Camera permission denied** - Guide them to browser settings
3. **Audio problems** - Help them check system volume and microphone
4. **Connection issues** - Suggest moving closer to WiFi router

**Your Role as Tech Support:**
- **Stay calm and patient** - technology anxiety is real
- **Provide simple, clear instructions** - avoid technical jargon
- **Have backup plans ready** - phone call, rescheduling
- **Reassure clients** - technical issues don't reflect on them

**Guiding Clients Through Setup:**
```
"I can see you're having trouble with your camera. Let's fix this together:
1. Look at the top of your browser - do you see a camera icon?
2. Click on that icon
3. Select 'Allow' for both camera and microphone
4. Now refresh the page by pressing F5
5. Try clicking 'Join Call' again"
```

### Building Rapport in Virtual Space

**Overcoming Virtual Barriers:**
- **Use the client's name frequently** to maintain connection
- **Acknowledge the technology** - "I know this feels different"
- **Be more expressive** - gestures and facial expressions may be less clear
- **Check in regularly** - "How is this working for you?"
- **Normalize technical difficulties** - "These things happen, let's work through it"

**Creating Therapeutic Presence:**
- **Maintain professional appearance** and background
- **Use appropriate lighting** so client can see your expressions
- **Minimize distractions** - close other applications, silence phone
- **Stay focused on the client** - avoid looking at yourself on screen
- **Use the same therapeutic techniques** you would in person
